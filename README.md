# ESP32S3 Simple Sounds

A lightweight, reliable audio playback system for the ESP32‑S3, supporting **MP3** and **WAV** playback from **FFat**, with a built‑in **Wi‑Fi AP**, optional **STA mode**, a simple **web UI**, and a full **file manager** powered by ESPFMfGK.

This project is designed for simple sound‑triggering applications, playlists, timed sequences, and remote control via HTTP.

## Program Concept and Construction.
- With the exception of this section, the program and README were written by Co-pilot using ChatGPT5.1 as an exercise to explore how well the AI could work with reasonably complex prompts.
- Numerous directed corrections were required to get the code working. AI needed multiple prompts to achieve operation, but the ability to read (via copy paste) compiler errors and runtime errors via the Serial monitor (again copy paste) helped save a lot of manual typing.

## Features

### 🎵 Audio Playback
- Supports **MP3** via ESP8266Audio (`AudioGeneratorMP3`)
- Supports **WAV** via ESP8266Audio (`AudioGeneratorWAV`)
- Automatic format detection based on file extension
- Smooth playback using I2S NoDAC mode
- Adjustable WAV playback rate via `wavspeed.txt`

### 📁 FFat File Storage
- All audio files stored in FFat
- File manager accessible via web browser
- Upload, delete, rename, and manage files directly

### 🌐 Wi‑Fi Modes
- **AP Mode** always enabled  
  - Default AP: `ESP32S3-Audio` / `12345678`  
  - AP IP: `192.168.4.1`
- **STA Mode** optional  
  - Reads credentials from `/wifi.json`
  - If STA fails, AP remains active and stable
- Auto‑reconnect disabled for maximum AP stability

### 🖥️ Web Interface
- Home page with:
  - Play Sequence button  
  - Play Playlist button  
  - File Manager link  
  - AP and STA IP display
- File Manager on port **8080**

### 🔊 Playback Modes

#### 1. Playlist Mode
Plays the first file listed in `/playlist.txt`.

#### 2. Sequence Mode
Plays a timed sequence of audio files defined in `/sequence.json`.

#### 3. Trigger Button
The ESP32S3 boot button (GPIO0) triggers playlist playback.

## File Formats

### 📄 playlist.txt

A simple text file listing audio filenames, one per line.

Example:
```json
/F1.wav
/F2.mp3
/alert.wav
```
##Code

Only the **first entry** is used by `/playplaylist` or the trigger button.

---

### 📄 sequence.json

A JSON array describing a timed sequence of audio events.

Each entry contains:
- `"file"` — path to the audio file  
- `"delay_ms"` — delay before playing the file  

Example:

```json
[
  { "file": "/intro.mp3", "delay_ms": 0 },
  { "file": "/beep.wav", "delay_ms": 500 },
  { "file": "/message.mp3", "delay_ms": 2000 }
]
```
The sequence player:
Waits delay_ms
Plays the file
Waits until playback finishes
Moves to the next item

### Wi‑Fi Configuration
/wifi.json
If present, STA mode will attempt to connect using these credentials.

Example:

```json
{
  "ssid": "MyNetwork",
  "password": "MyPassword"
}
```
If missing, the device uses fallback credentials and remains in AP mode.

## HTTP Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/` | Home page |
| `/playplaylist` | Plays first entry in `playlist.txt` |
| `/playsequence` | Plays the full sequence from `sequence.json` |
| `/reconnectwifi` *(optional)* | Attempts STA reconnection |
| `http://<ip>:8080/` | File manager |
